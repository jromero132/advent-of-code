# --- Part Two ---

The crabs don't seem interested in your proposed solution. Perhaps you misunderstand crab engineering?

As it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate[^1]. Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first step costs `1`, the second step costs `2`, the third step costs `3`, and so on.

As each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive. This changes the best horizontal position to align them all on; in the example above, this becomes `5`:
    - Move from `16` to `5`: `66` fuel
    - Move from `1` to `5`: `10` fuel
    - Move from `2` to `5`: `6` fuel
    - Move from `0` to `5`: `15` fuel
    - Move from `4` to `5`: `1` fuel
    - Move from `2` to `5`: `6` fuel
    - Move from `7` to `5`: `3` fuel
    - Move from `1` to `5`: `10` fuel
    - Move from `2` to `5`: `6` fuel
    - Move from `14` to `5`: `45` fuel

This costs a total of `**168**` fuel. This is the new cheapest possible outcome; the old alignment position (`2`) now costs `206` fuel instead.

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible so they can make you an escape route! **How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?**

[^1]: [don't burn fuel at a constant rate] This appears to be due to the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive duractance.
