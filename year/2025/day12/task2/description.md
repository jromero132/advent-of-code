# --- Part Two ---

The Elves thank you profusely for the help[^1] and start rearranging the oddly-shaped presents. As you look up, you notice that a lot more Elves have arrived here at the Christmas tree farm.

In fact, many of these new arrivals look **familiar**: they're the Elves you helped while decorating the North Pole base. Right on [schedule](1), each group seems to have brought a **star** to put atop one of the Christmas trees!

Before any of them can find a ladder, a particularly large Christmas tree suddenly flashes brightly when a large **star** magically appears above it! As your eyes readjust, you think you notice a portly man with a white beard disappear into the crowd.

You go look for a ladder; only **23 stars** to go.

[^1]: [help] I need to throw in a puzzle like this occasionally to keep everyone on their toes, right?
